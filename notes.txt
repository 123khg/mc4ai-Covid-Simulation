What the project aim:

1. Simulate Covid:
- Simulate people and how the infection spread
    + People move randomly according to scenarios:
        ++ Move the same in every mode but with some extra abilities

        ++ With many cities, some people has a chance 
           of traveling to a random city (plot)

        ++ With social distancing, people stil move randomly but are
           affected by how close they are to the nearest people

        ++ With centered area, some people has a chance of 
           moving towards the center and back
           
        ++ With isolation, infected gets put into a chamber (plot)

    + has a chance of getting infected when near infected ones

- Simulate different scenarios:
    + Default: do nothing

    + Centeral Area: theres a shopping mall

    + Social Distancing: distance from each other

    + Vaccinated: some people has a chance to get vaccinated and immune 
                  to Covid for a period, after that they become susceptible

    + Isolation:  catch infected after being spotted for some days
                  all initial infected ones show no symptoms

- Simulate how the population gets infected/cured via a live graph

2. Store all the Figures from each scenarios for analysis
- After each run when the user hit "Stop", return the live fig

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What core function is missing:

How people move for each scenarios
Getting Infected
Plots for each scenarios, Default is almost done
